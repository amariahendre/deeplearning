# Introduction to Deep Learning

Welcome to the Introduction to Deep Learning project! This project is intended to provide a basic understanding of deep learning and its implementation using Keras, a high-level neural networks API.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install these packages using pip, the Python package manager:

``` pip install keras numpy matplotlib```

## Project Structure 

This project contains the following files:

- README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- intro_to_deep_learning.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook that provides an introduction to deep learning and its implementation using Keras.

## Example Implementation

The intro_to_deep_learning.ipynb notebook contains an example implementation of a simple neural network using Keras. The network is trained on the MNIST dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits.

The notebook provides step-by-step instructions on how to build and train the neural network using Keras, as well as how to evaluate its performance on the test dataset.
